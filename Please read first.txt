Thank you for considering me for the Data Engineering Lead position and providing me with the opportunity to participate in the recruitment process. 
I am thrilled to present my home assignment, which showcases my skills and passion for data engineering.

Please note that while I have made significant progress in completing most of the tasks, due to unforeseen time constraints,
I was unable to polish them to the level I desired. However, I am eager to continue working on this project during the week or explain my approach and ideas further during the interview.

In this repository, you will find my web application designed to display data on characters from various websites related to Valhalla, the Viking heaven.

I am excited to discuss my approach, challenges faced, and potential solutions during the interview.
Additionally, I am more than willing to collaborate further on this project to ensure it meets the desired standards.

Thank you for considering my application, and I am looking forward to the opportunity to discuss my work in person.
