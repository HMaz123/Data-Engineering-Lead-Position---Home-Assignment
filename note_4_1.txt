The end-to-end pipeline described below focuses on scraping character information from the TV show "Vikings" and storing it in a PostgreSQL database. The pipeline includes data scraping, image downloading, data transformation, and data insertion into the database. The pipeline is designed to be robust to errors and handles potential issues such as scraping failures and data quality problems.

Data Scraping:
The pipeline starts by scraping character information from the TV show "Vikings" from a specific website. The web scraping process extracts data such as character names, actor names, and image URLs using the BeautifulSoup library. The script fetches data from the source website and converts it into a list of dictionaries containing character data (character_name, actor_name, image_url).

Image Downloading:
After extracting character data, the pipeline proceeds to download character images from the provided image URLs. The script uses the requests library to fetch the images and saves them in a local "images" folder using the PIL library. Each image is saved with a unique name based on the character's name.

Data Transformation:
The extracted character data is converted into a pandas DataFrame for further processing. The DataFrame allows easy manipulation and filtering of the data. Additionally, the data is saved to a CSV file for later use if needed.

Data Insertion into PostgreSQL Database:
Next, the character data is inserted into a PostgreSQL database using the psycopg2 library for database connectivity. The script connects to the database and creates an "INSERT" query to store the character information in the "characters" table. The table should have appropriate columns to store character_name, actor_name, and image_url.

Scheduling and Frequency:
The frequency of updating the pipeline can be scheduled based on the requirements and availability of new data. For instance, the pipeline can be run daily, weekly, or at specific intervals to capture any updates or changes in the TV show's character information.

Error Handling and Robustness:
To ensure robustness, the pipeline incorporates error handling mechanisms to handle potential issues during the data scraping process, image downloading, and data insertion into the database. Key measures include:

a. Scraping Failures: The script handles scenarios where the website is down or inaccessible, ensuring that the pipeline does not break. If a scraping failure occurs, the script may retry after a certain delay or log the error for investigation.

b. Image Downloading: The pipeline handles image download failures by checking the HTTP response status code and logging any unsuccessful attempts. It skips the failed downloads and continues with the rest of the images.

c. Data Quality Issues: The pipeline performs data validation and cleaning before inserting data into the database. It ensures that the character data is in the expected format and handles any anomalies or missing values gracefully.

d. Database Connection: The script handles potential database connection issues by managing connection retries and logging any errors that may occur during the data insertion process.

Overall, the end-to-end pipeline provides a reliable and automated solution for updating character information from the TV show "Vikings." It is designed to be flexible, allowing easy adjustments to the frequency of updates and error handling mechanisms. Additionally, the pipeline provides a scalable foundation for future enhancements and expansions to accommodate additional data sources or improve data quality processes.
